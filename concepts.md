Charms:
- Charms fill out a Principle; each Charm Tree lives inside an Aspect of the Principle
- Charms can gate you into a thing that is not really a charm as such
  - Eg Sorcerous Initiation Charms, Necromantic Initiation Charms, Martial Arts Charms, Astrology Charms, ...

Exalted Charms:
- The Principles all had to be things compatible with Humans
- Each Exaltation Type could only fit one Principle
  - Attributes - Lunars
  - Abilities - Solars, Abyssals
  - Backgrounds - Sideareals
    - Eg Resources, Status, Face etc...
  - Action Types/Roles/States - Dragonblooded
    - Eg the Injured charm tree, the Combat charm tree, the Joining Battle charm tree, the Mass Combat charm tree, the Downtime charm tree, the Group Action charm tree...
  - Equipment - Alchemicals
    - Eg Weapons, Armour, Vehicles, Accoutrements, Tools, Factories, Lockpicks, Paperwork
  - Stunts - The nonexistent Rakshasa Exalted
- The Infernals are interesting because they were opened up to Charms from the Principles of a number of Yozi.

Principles connect to/are Shintai. Primordial Shintai, Twisted Shintai, Dead Shintai, and Lesser Shintai.

The Loom of Fate is connected to the Stars. There are no Stars in Malfeas, and any Stars in a Waypoint are completely local to it.

Creation's wake/the echoes left by the clash of Shintai/powerful enough acts of Shaping leave marks that show up in waygates in the Wyld.

Fave vs predetermination - anything that is predetermined will happen, but predetermination is a lot looser than 'Fate'.
Eg you are fated as a mortal to be killed by a group of Chosen, but instead you kill them. You defied Fate, but it was predetermined that if the meeting happened, it would end in killing.
Defying Fate is an extraordinary action for anyone who is not a Chosen.

Extraordinary actions vs ordinary actions
- Extraordinary action consume stunts, ordinary actions are boosted (eg, they get dice bonus plus a kicker) by stunts
- Eg crafting usable tools out of random detritus is an extraordinary action, which usually consumes points worth of valid stunts equal to the square of the level of the tool
- But, you could have a charm that makes construction of usable tools out of random detritus an ordinary action, as long as you meet some condition
- Flipping Fate to an alternate interpretation is
