Principles connect to/are Shintai. Primordial Shintai, Twisted Shintai, Dead Shintai, and Lesser Shintai.

The Loom of Fate is connected to the Stars. There are no Stars in Malfeas, and any Stars in a Waypoint are completely local to it.

Creation's wake/the echoes left by the clash of Shintai/powerful enough acts of Shaping leave marks that show up in waygates in the Wyld.
